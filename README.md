# Pig Latin using TDD
## What Pig Latin is
Pig Latin takes the first letter(s) of a word until the first vowel, puts them to the end, and adds "ay", eg cable -> ablecay, brush -> ushbray.
If the word starts with a vowel, "yay" is just added onto the end, eg apple -> appleyay.
## Test-Driven Development
This was coded using Pytest and TDD to check if the code was running smoothly, using CI in the workflows.
